Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) is Amazon’s scalable storage solution. Data in S3 is stored
redundantly across multiple facilities and servers. The event notifications system
allows S3 to send events to SNS , SQS , or Lambda when objects are created or deleted.
S3 is secure by default, with only owners having access to the resources they create, but
it’s possible to set more granular and flexible access permissions using access control
lists and bucket policies.
S3 uses the concept of buckets and objects. Buckets are high-level directories or con-
tainers for objects. Objects are a combination of data, metadata, and a key. A key is a
unique identifier for an object in a bucket. S3 also supports the concept of a folder as a
means of grouping objects in the S3 console. Folders work by using key name prefixes.
A forward slash character “/” in the key name delineates a folder. For example, an
object with the key name documents/personal/myfile.txt is represented as a folder
called documents, containing a folder called personal, containing the file myfile.txt in
the S3 console.

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a highly scalable and secure cloud storage solution provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here's a detailed breakdown of its key features and concepts:

Scalable Storage:

    S3 is designed to provide virtually unlimited and scalable storage capacity. It stores data redundantly across multiple AWS facilities and servers to ensure data durability and availability.

Event Notifications:

    S3 can send event notifications to other AWS services such as Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service), Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service), or AWS Lambda when objects are created, updated, or deleted in the S3 buckets. This feature allows you to trigger actions or workflows in response to changes in your storage.

Default Security:

    By default, S3 is secure, and only the owners of resources (buckets and objects) have access to them. This means that data is private and protected by default.

Access Control:

    S3 provides robust access control mechanisms to set granular and flexible permissions for your resources. This can be achieved using Access Control Lists (ACLs) and bucket policies, allowing you to define who can access, modify, or delete your objects.

Bucket and Object Concepts:

    S3 organizes data into two main concepts:
        Buckets: Buckets are high-level containers or directories for objects. They serve as logical storage containers, and each bucket has a unique name. You can think of buckets as top-level folders.
        Objects: Objects are the actual data stored within buckets. They consist of the data itself, metadata (information about the data), and a unique key that identifies the object within the bucket.
        Keys: Keys are unique identifiers for objects within a bucket. They help you locate and retrieve specific objects. Keys can include prefixes separated by forward slashes, allowing you to create a hierarchical structure and mimic the concept of folders.
        Folders: While S3 doesn't have traditional folders, you can create a folder-like structure using key name prefixes. A forward slash character ("/") in the key name indicates a folder. For example, "documents/personal/myfile.txt" represents a file ("myfile.txt") within a folder ("personal") inside another folder ("documents").

In summary, Amazon S3 is a versatile and highly reliable storage service that offers scalability, event notifications, robust security, and a hierarchical organization of data using buckets, objects, and key names. It's widely used for storing, retrieving, and managing various types of data in the cloud.
