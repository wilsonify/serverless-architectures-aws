Auth0 is a non- AWS identity management product that has a few features that Cognito
doesn’t. Auth0 integrates with more than 30 identity providers, including Google,
Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, LinkedIn, and Windows Live. It provides a way to register
new users through the use of its own user database, without having to integrate with
an identity provider. In addition, it has a facility to import users from other databases.
As expected, Auth0 supports standard industry protocols including SAML , OpenID
Connect, OAuth 2.0, OAuth 1.0, and JSON Web Token. It’s dead simple to integrate
with AWS Identity and Access Management and with Cognito.

Auth0 is a robust identity management and authentication service that offers a range of features for identity integration and user management. While it is not an AWS service, it can be used in conjunction with AWS services like Amazon Cognito. Here are some key features and differentiators of Auth0:

Integration with Multiple Identity Providers:

    Auth0 seamlessly integrates with more than 30 identity providers, including popular ones like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, LinkedIn, and Windows Live. This means users can sign in to applications using their existing accounts from these providers.

Custom User Database:

    Auth0 provides the capability to create and manage your own user database, allowing for user registration and authentication without the need for external identity providers. This is useful when you want to maintain control over user data.

User Data Import:

    Auth0 offers features to import user data from other databases, making it easy to transition and consolidate user information from different sources.

Support for Industry Protocols:

    Auth0 supports standard industry protocols such as SAML, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, OAuth 1.0, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). These protocols are commonly used for authentication and authorization.

Integration with AWS Services:

    Auth0 can be easily integrated with AWS services, including AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Cognito. This allows you to leverage Auth0 for user authentication and authorization in your AWS-based applications.

Simplicity of Integration:

    Auth0 offers straightforward integration options, making it easy to connect with other identity management and authentication systems, including AWS Cognito.

In summary, Auth0 is a versatile identity management solution that extends beyond AWS services and provides seamless integration with various identity providers and industry-standard protocols. It offers features like custom user databases, user data import, and support for multiple identity providers. When combined with AWS services, Auth0 can enhance the authentication and user management capabilities of applications running in the AWS ecosystem.
