The Amazon API Gateway is a service that you can use to create an API layer between
the front-end and back-end services. The lifecycle management of the API Gateway
allows multiple versions of the API to be run at the same time, and it supports multiple
release stages such as development, staging, and production. API Gateway also comes
with useful features like caching and throttling of requests.
The API is defined around resources and methods. A resource is a logical entity
such as a user or product. A method is a combination of an HTTP verb, such as GET ,
POST , PUT , or DELETE , and the resource path. The API Gateway integrates with
Lambda and, as youâ€™ll see in chapter 7, makes moving data in and out of Lambda
straightforward. API Gateway can also connect to various AWS services via an AWS ser-
vice proxy and forward requests to regular HTTP endpoints.



The Amazon API Gateway is a powerful service that acts as a bridge or intermediary layer between the front-end and back-end services of your application. Here's a breakdown of its key features and functions:

Lifecycle Management:

    API Gateway allows you to manage the life cycle of your APIs effectively. This means you can have multiple versions of your API running simultaneously, which is useful for testing new features or changes without disrupting the existing version. It also supports different release stages, such as development, staging, and production, ensuring smooth transitions between different environments.

Caching and Throttling:

    API Gateway provides built-in caching and throttling features. Caching can help improve the response time of your API by storing and reusing previously generated responses. Throttling allows you to control the rate at which clients can make requests to your API, preventing overloads and ensuring fair usage.

API Structure:

    The API is structured around two main concepts: resources and methods.
        Resource: A resource represents a logical entity in your application, such as a user, product, or any other data object.
        Method: A method is a combination of an HTTP verb (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and a resource path. It defines how clients can interact with a specific resource.

Integration with Lambda:

    One of the standout features of API Gateway is its seamless integration with AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service. This integration simplifies the process of passing data in and out of Lambda functions. You can use Lambda to execute code in response to API requests, making it easy to build serverless back ends for your APIs.

Connecting to AWS Services:

    API Gateway is not limited to Lambda integration. It can also connect to various AWS services via an AWS service proxy. This allows you to forward API requests to other AWS services, making it a versatile tool for building complex and interconnected applications.

In summary, Amazon API Gateway is a versatile and scalable service that enables you to create, manage, and secure APIs efficiently. It plays a crucial role in modern application development, providing a convenient way to connect front-end applications with back-end services while offering essential features like caching, throttling, and integration with AWS Lambda and other AWS services.
