Firebase (owned by Google) is a company and also a suite of interesting products.
One of the products that we particularly like is its NoSQL real-time database. Data in
Firebase is stored as JSON . One of the nice things about Firebase is its real-time syn-
chronization. It allows all connected users to receive updates as soon as they happen.
Firebase can be accessed through a REST API and through client libraries, which are
available for different languages and platforms. Firebase also has services for static
hosting of files and authentication of users.
