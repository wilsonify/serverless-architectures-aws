CloudSearch is a search solution from AWS that supports structured data and plain
text. CloudSearch takes snippets of data as JSON or XML and generates an index that
can be queried. This service supports Boolean, prefix, range, and full-text search, as
well as faceting, highlighting, and autocomplete. Every document provided to Cloud-
Search is supplied with an ID , generated by the user, that makes the document
uniquely identifiable. Search requests can be carried out using GET requests. Results
can be returned as JSON or XML , and they can be sorted and paginated and include
useful metadata such as a relevance score.
