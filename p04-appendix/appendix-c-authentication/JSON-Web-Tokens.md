JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a widely used open standard for securely transmitting claims or information between parties in a compact and self-contained format. JWTs are particularly valuable in serverless systems for several reasons:

    URL-Safe: JWTs are designed to be URL-safe, which means they can be included in the body of HTTP requests or passed in URL query parameters without causing issues. This makes them versatile for use in various parts of web and serverless applications.

    Compact and Self-Contained: JWTs are compact in size, making them efficient for transmitting data over the network. They are also self-contained, meaning that they include all the necessary information within the token itself, eliminating the need for additional server-side storage or database queries.

    Digital Signature: JWTs can be digitally signed using a secret key or a public-private key pair. This signature allows the recipient to verify the token's authenticity and integrity. If the token has been tampered with, the signature will not match, indicating that the token is invalid.

    Encryption: JWTs can also be encrypted to provide confidentiality for the data within the token. This is particularly useful when sensitive information needs to be transmitted securely between parties.

    Open Standard: JWT is an open standard defined by RFC 7519. This means that the format and structure of JWTs are well-documented and widely accepted. As a result, developers can easily create, parse, and validate JWTs using libraries available for various programming languages, including JavaScript and others.

JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web and serverless applications. They can represent claims about a user, such as their identity, roles, and permissions, and are often used as tokens for authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

In serverless architectures, JWTs can be employed to securely transmit user identity and authorization information between serverless functions and other components of the application, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access specific resources and services.
