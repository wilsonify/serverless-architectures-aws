The OAuth 2.0 specification (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749), which is used by
OpenID Connect, defines four different grant types for different authorization scenarios:
 Authorization code for applications running on a web server including server-
side rendered web apps: This is a common grant type that implements three-
legged OAuth. If you’ve used GitHub, Google, Facebook, or another identity
provider to sign in to a website or application, then you’ve experienced it.
In an authorization code grant, an authorization server—or the IdP—acts as
an intermediary between the client (that is, the website or application that the
user wants to log on to) and the resource owner (that is, the user). When the
user signs in to the authorization server, they’re redirected to the client with
an authorization code, which the client captures and exchanges with the autho-
rization server for an access token. A client can then access a resource server
with the access token and retrieve protected resources.
 Implicit for mobile or browser-based JavaScript-only apps that can’t be trusted
with maintaining client secrets: The implicit grant type is a simplified variation
of the authorization code flow. As before, the user is redirected to the authori-
zation server to sign in, but instead of the server returning an authentication
code, the client is immediately sent an access token. The implicit grant type
is needed for the class of applications where the client is unable to store
secrets. But there are security implications to using the implicit grant type. It
should be used as a second choice when the authorization code grant type is
unavailable.
 Resource owner credentials for directly logging in to a client with a username
and password: This is similar to the type of authentication shown in figure
C.1. A resource owner provides credentials directly to the client, which
exchanges them for an access token.
 Client credentials for accessing resources outside any user’s specific context:
This grant type is useful for machine-to-machine authorization where the cli-
ent uses its own credentials as an authorization grant.



OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted authorization framework that allows applications to access resources on behalf of users, while maintaining security and user consent. The OAuth 2.0 specification defines four different grant types for various authorization scenarios:

    Authorization Code Grant (Three-Legged OAuth):
        Use Case: Typically used for applications running on a web server, including server-side rendered web apps.
        Flow: In this grant type, the user interacts with a client (e.g., a website or application) that wants to access protected resources on their behalf. The flow involves the following steps:
            The user is redirected to the authorization server or Identity Provider (IdP) to sign in.
            Upon successful authentication, the authorization server issues an authorization code to the client.
            The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token from the authorization server.
            With the access token, the client can access protected resources on a resource server.

    Implicit Grant:
        Use Case: Used for mobile or browser-based JavaScript-only apps that cannot securely store client secrets.
        Flow: The implicit grant is a simplified version of the authorization code flow. Here's how it works:
            The user is redirected to the authorization server to sign in.
            Instead of receiving an authorization code, the client is immediately provided with an access token.
            This grant type is suitable for scenarios where the client cannot securely store secrets, but it has security implications and should be a second choice when the authorization code grant is not feasible.

    Resource Owner Credentials Grant:
        Use Case: Allows a client to directly obtain an access token by collecting the user's username and password.
        Flow: In this grant type:
            The user provides their credentials (username and password) directly to the client application.
            The client exchanges these credentials for an access token from the authorization server.
            The client can then use the access token to access resources on behalf of the user.

    Client Credentials Grant:
        Use Case: Used for machine-to-machine authorization, where the client application acts on its own behalf (outside any user's context).
        Flow: In this grant type:
            The client application uses its own credentials (e.g., API key or client ID and secret) to request an access token from the authorization server.
            The access token is issued directly to the client application.
            The client can use the access token to access resources that do not require user-specific context.

Each grant type serves a specific purpose and is suitable for different use cases, depending on factors like the client type, security requirements, and whether user interaction is involved. It's important to choose the appropriate grant type based on the specific needs of your application and its security model.
