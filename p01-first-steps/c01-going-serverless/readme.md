# Cloud Computing and Serverless Architectures

## Cloud Computing as a Game Changer

The cloud has been and continues to be a game changer for IT infrastructure and software development. 

Software developers need to think about the ways they can maximize the use of cloud platforms to gain a competitive advantage.

## Serverless Architectures

Serverless architectures are the latest advance for developers and organizations to think about, study, and adopt. 

This exciting new shift in architecture will grow quickly as software developers embrace compute services such as AWS Lambda. 

And, in many cases, serverless applications will be cheaper to run and faster to implement.

## Reducing Complexity and Costs

There's also a need to reduce complexity and costs associated with running infrastructure 
and carrying out development of traditional software systems. 

The reduction in cost and time spent on infrastructure maintenance 
and the benefits of scalability are good reasons for organizations and developers to consider serverless architectures.
