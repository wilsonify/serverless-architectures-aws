## Authentication and Authorization:

This chapter explored how to make sure only 
the right people (authentication) can do 
the right things (authorization) in a serverless application. 

Think of it as setting up a secure entrance to a club - only members with the right tickets are allowed in.

Authentication is like proving who you are, 
like showing your ID to enter a club.
    
Authorization is like getting permission once you're inside, 
such as being allowed into a VIP area.

## Services Communicating with the Client:

Services, like different parts of your app, need to talk to the people using your app. 

It's like a waiter taking orders and serving food directly to customers in a restaurant.

Think of it as different parts of an app talking directly to you,

like a restaurant where the kitchen (service) takes your order and brings you food without a waiter in between.

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT):

JWT is like a digital ID card. 

It's a secure way for your app to know who someone is without constantly asking for their username and password.

A JWT is like a digital ID card that proves who you are. 

It's handy because you don't need to keep showing your ID; 

once you've shown it, you're trusted.

## Auth0:

Auth0 is like hiring a security expert to manage who gets into your club. 

It helps with authentication and authorization, 
making sure only the right people get access.
    
Auth0 is like a super doorman who checks everyone's ID and makes sure only the right people get into your party.

## Delegation Tokens:

Delegation tokens are like special passes. 

They allow someone to move between different parts of your club (services) 
without needing to show their ID card every time.

These are like special stamps on your hand 
that let you go to different parts of the party 
without showing your ID card every time.
